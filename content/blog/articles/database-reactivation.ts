  intro: [
    'Database reactivation means going back to people who already asked you for a quote or a booking and never bought, and restarting the conversation, usually by text. It works because these people already know who you are and already had the problem; most of them just got busy, went quiet, or never heard back.',
    'For most service businesses it is the fastest money available, because the leads are already paid for. A solar installer we worked with had more than 4,000 homeowners sitting in a list nobody touched. A three-week reactivation campaign re-engaged 832 of them, booked 38 appointments and produced $24,500 in net profit, with no manual outreach from the sales team.',

  tldr: [
    'Your old leads and unsigned estimates are a list of people who already raised their hand.',
    'Check consent first: only text people who gave you their number and agreed to hear from you, and honor every opt-out.',
    'Lead with a short, specific question, not a discount. Then have someone (or an AI) answer every reply fast.',
    'Run it in waves over two to three weeks, and measure replies, appointments and closed jobs.',

        'In the solar case, the sales team was pointed at fresh paid leads, and the old list held little more than a name, a phone number and a state. Working it by hand would have taken dozens of hours a week, so it sat for years while the company kept paying for new leads. That is the pattern we see in almost every business we look at. The full numbers are in /evidence/solar-dormant-database.',
